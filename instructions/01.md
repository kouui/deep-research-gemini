# instruction to create project with Roo Code.

this is a project to convert the n8n workflow (deep research with gemini) to python implementation using Autogen.

n8n workflow json file : `Deep_research_with_Gemini_Apify_Notion_database.json`

python environment setup is ready by using uv. feel free to install package using `uv pip install ...`

the implementation steps :
1. the workflow use `Form` to collect necesarry query/parameters. please use streamlit to implement similar UI for query/parameter. Acknowledge is originally implemented in droplist, but checkbox + label should be fine. research could no be started until all input/checkbox are filled.
2. after 1. the workflow use LLM agent to generate 3 questions to add some complments to the original query.
3. generate a `title` and `description` given the above information using LLM agent.
4. the `depth` and `breath` parameter is used to control the "research" iteration.
5. research:
    1. loop to produce "learnings"
        1. generate search query (using LLM agent) for fetching content from "RAG Web Browser"
        2. fetch content from "RAG Web Browser" using apify (actor : "RAG Web Browser") api
        3. generate "learnings" (using LLM agent) base on the fetched contents and given information
        4. collect all "learnings" and "urls" (returned by "RAG Web Browser" ) generated in all iterations
    2. base on all the "learnings", output a report in markdown format using LLM agent.


note:
1. Gemini and Apify API key store in .env file
2. some branchs in the workflow is for debugging, ignore them
3. the workflow use Notion database to store output, since we export the markdown to streamlit directly, Notion is unnecessary. 
4. the agent should have the same prompt as those in the original workflow.


important :
1. use Autogen framework for creating LLM agent
2. all LLM agents should have the same prompt as those in the original workflow.
3. feel free to reference the original workflow if necessary
4. structure the code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. for example, UI and each agent logic should be placed in a separate file.
5. create the UI first and then implement the agents.
